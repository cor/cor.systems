    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a 19 year old developer who is specialized in building web applications using Vue.js, but likes doing (almost) every kind of programming.</p>
    <p>My interest in programming started when I was 11 years old. My dad thaught me how write basic command line programs in C, and since then I've worked on a lot of different programming projects, using numerous languages, frameworks and technologies. I have worked professionally as a web developer and designer for a few clients, and continue to do so.</p>
