        "description": "I worked on an unreleased project for Unboxing Solutions. In this project I fulfilled the role of designing and building an entire Vue.js SPA, which included interacting a lot with a RESTful API. I worked closely together with the lead back end developer, and had meaningful discussions on the API design and it's interaction with the client side aplication. We switched between a lot of different technologies, and I learned a lot from the process of building this application. I especially learned a lot about designing a great front-end web SPA architecture, optimizing user experiences and interacting with an API in a transparent, real time way. Working for Unboxing Solutions has by far been my most valuable programming experience.",
