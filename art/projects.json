This was a fun challenge, but we did not like that it wasn't multiplatform and that it only achieved 5 FPS (even after multithreading our CPU renderer and running on an 8-core machine). Therefore we decided to port our raytracer into a WebGL shader and we wrote a shader precompiler so that we could dynamically insert our CPU determined scenes into our shader-based raytracer. We also added an animation library that interpolates between scenes in order to show fancy animations. We got a grade of 9.5 for this project.",
